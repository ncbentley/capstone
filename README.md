> WePortal is a web application that allows a developer and a client to connect on projects. Clients can create sprints with infinitely many tasks within as well as pages with just as many different wireframes. Developers can view these wireframes full screen to have something to reference when designing the client's site. They can also enter into sprints in order completing tasks. Sprints are not unlocked until the previous sprint is completed.
